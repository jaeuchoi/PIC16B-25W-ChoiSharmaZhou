The model we chose to use was the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and a CNN (Convolution Nerual Network). LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that is designed to process sequential data. This is important to us because images with words on them are just sequences of characters. Unlike traditional RNNs, which suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, LSTMs use gates (input, forget, and output) to selectively retain and discard information, allowing them to remember important patterns in handwriting across longer sequences.

        "The model has been trained for 50 epochs, showing steady learning progress with a final validation loss of 11.1003 and a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.6102. The CER steadily decreased over training, indicating that the model was learning meaningful patterns. The transition from CER = 0.6626 to 0.6102 suggests that the model successfully reduces errors, though a lower CER would be preferable. Also, from the decoded prediction being printed, we can see a lot of successful prediction, especially for words with fewer letters. Despite initial misclassifications, the model learns to filter out extraneous information and improves prediction accuracy. The exponential learning rate decay strategy ensures that the training remains stable while gradually fine-tuning the model."

        "However, there are still many clear drawbacks of the model. Some predictions exhibit frequent misclassifications of characters, such as:  \"background\" being predicted as \"ganvrnment”, “doctor\" being predicted as \"toteo\". The model occasionally omits characters, which suggests that it struggles with character spacing or specific handwriting styles. More importantly, the model is currently not user interactive. One of our key goals of this project is creating an user interactive dash app which the user can input an handwritten image and the correct output will be spit out by the website. This lead us to building model 2."
